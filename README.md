# Homework 1 AI Synthesis Activity

## Activity B: You did NOT use AI
### Part 1
One improvement I want to make is utilizing functions in JavaScript to make some of the data processing a bit more efficient. For example, I think I could probably use some functions like reduce to make my queries cleaner and faster, rather than iterating through a lot of entries.

### Part 2

### Part 3
The AI's solution does fit within the scope of my project and does work correctly. I think its utilization of reduce instead of forEach was very clean and made the logic a bit cleaner than before, as well as reducing memory usage since the new solution does not need to store the aggregate information in new Objects. The use of destructuring and short-circuiting was also very intuitive and clean. Overall, I think the changes made the logic much easier to follow, and the declarative style is great.
